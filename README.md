# DCF77 Retro Clock
Retro Clock which uses the DCF77 signal for retriving accurate time. This project should help me to learn embedded Rust. I'm picking up some work my father
did in the early 1970's - without a microcontroller - just based on discret logic. The hardware used for this project is the Adafruit STM32F405 Express and the DCF77
receiver module HKW EM2S DCF.
